# TinDog Project
Tindog is a social app for dogs and their owners to find new friends and potential playmates. The app uses a swipe-based system to match dogs and their owners based on their location and interests. Users can create profiles for their furry friends, upload photos, and chat with other users. It's a fun and unique way to connect with other dog owners and their pets.
